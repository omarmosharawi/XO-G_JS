# XO-Game

Welcome to the XO-G_JS repository! This project is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic simple Tic Tac Toe game, also known as X-O, using JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with this game, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser, or visit the live demo here [XO-Game_JS](https://omarmosharawi.github.io/XO-G_JS/).

- bash `git clone https://github.com/omarmosharawi/XO-G_JS.git`
- `cd XO-G_JS`
- open `index.html`

# How to Play
The game is a two-player game played on a grid thatâ€™s 3 squares by 3 squares. Player 1 is X, and Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is considered a draw.
